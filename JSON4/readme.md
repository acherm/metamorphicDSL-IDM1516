The exercice is to develop a program in the DSL in three
equivalent variants:
–  One variant with the external shape of the DSL
–  Two variants with an internal shape of the DSL, in two different GPLs
–  The three variants should have the same behavior

DSL : **Json**
Internal shapes : **Javascript & PHP**
